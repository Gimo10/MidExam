        <H1>Chocolate Hills</H1>
        <p>The hills are located throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan and consist of about 1,776 mounds of the same general shape. During the dry season when precipitation in inadequate, 
            the grass-covered hills turn chocolate brown, hence the name in reference to a branded confection. The Chocolate Hills showcase its iconic chocolate brown look during the dry months of January to May. During the rainy season, the hills' grass turns into a vibrant green, giving them that mint chocolate color. More travelers visit during the dry season when the hills appear exactly as it's called.
